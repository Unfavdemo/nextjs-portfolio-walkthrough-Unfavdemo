# Public Folder - Place Your Images Here

This folder is for **static files** that can be accessed directly via URL.

## What Goes Here

- Profile photos
- Project screenshots
- Icons and logos
- Any images you want to use on your site

## How to Use Images

### Step 1: Add your image to this folder

```
public/
  └── my-photo.jpg  ← Your image here
```

### Step 2: Use the Image component in your pages

```javascript
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image 
  src="/my-photo.jpg"  // Note: starts with / (not public/)
  alt="Description of image"
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>
```

## Image Requirements

- **Supported formats:** JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF, SVG
- **Recommended size:** Under 1MB per image
- **Profile photos:** 300x300px or larger
- **Project images:** 800x600px recommended

## Need Placeholder Images?

Use these free services:

- **Unsplash:** https://unsplash.com (free stock photos)
- **UI Avatars:** https://ui-avatars.com (generated profile pics)
- **PlaceHolder:** https://placehold.co (placeholder images)

## Important Notes

- Always include an `alt` attribute for accessibility
- File names should be lowercase with no spaces (use-dashes-instead)
- Don't commit very large images (they slow down your repo)
